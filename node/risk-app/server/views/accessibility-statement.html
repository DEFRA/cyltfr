      <p class="govuk-body">
        The Environment Agency is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector
        Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        This website is partially compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web
          Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>, due to the following exemptions.

      </p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons. </p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h4>



      <p class="govuk-body">There are a number of elements of the map user interface that are not fully descriptive or
        accessible. These are: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the colour contrast of the scale icon used on the Ordnance Survey mapping fails to meet the required
          contrast ratio (WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast - Level AA) in certain situations</li>
        <li>the colour contrast used in various elements of the mapping fails to meet the required contrast ratio (WCAG
          1.4.3 Contrast - Level AA) in certain situations</li>
        <li>the zoom controls provided on the maps do not provide a label that is descriptive enough to inform a user of
          their function (WCAG 2.4.6 Headings and labels - Level AA)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">We are looking to fix these issues in the following ways: </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>we are exploring ways to improve the accessibility of the controls on the map user interface so that they
          are more descriptive and usable before December 2025</li>
        <li>we are planning an investigation of a more accessible scheme to differentiate layers used in mapping across
          all flood services. We plan to carry out this work before December 2025</li>
        <li>we are planning an investigation about offering alternative, more accessible versions of the Ordnance Survey
          mapping layers before December 2025</li>
        <li>we will carry out an accessibility audit in February 2025. This will be followed by usability testing with 
          people with accessibility needs</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h4>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        The website has the following content which is out of scope of the accessibility regulations:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

        <li>third party content which is out of our control, for example a corporate logo on the map the website uses
        </li>
        <li>PDF content that was published before 23 September 2018</li>
