      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Long term flood risk information</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        All information, particularly the likelihood of surface water flooding, is a broad indicator of an area's flood risk. As such it is not suitable for identifying whether an individual property will flood. This service uses computer models to assess an area's long term flood risk from rivers, the sea, surface water, reservoirs and some groundwater. It does not include flood risk from sources such as blocked drains and burst pipes.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The scale of flood risk, whatever the source, varies according to:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>how far it is from the source of flooding</li>
        <li>how high the property is above ground level</li>
        <li>the existence, position and effectiveness of local flood defences</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        We do not hold records on height of property above the ground.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Flooding can be caused by other water sources, for example surface water, overwhelmed sewers or drains, or groundwater from underground aquifers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Use of long term flood risk information</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        It is not possible to say for certain what the flood risk is at any specific place or time, but we use the best information available to provide an indication. We do this to help people and insurers make informed choices about living with or managing flood risk.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        As our information relates to an area rather than a specific property, not all properties within that area (which could be a street or a postcode) will necessarily be at the same risk of flooding. This might be the case if the property is on higher land or the floor levels are high.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The flood information we provide is for sites in or near an area at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea, surface water, reservoirs and some groundwater. It does not cover other sources of flooding such as from local drains. However our records on historic flooding can include flooding from groundwater.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        We log historic flooding where we have adequate records and do not have a record of all past flooding. If an area of land is shown outside the extent of recorded flooding it doesn't mean it has never flooded, simply that we don't hold a record of the area of land being flooded.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Any information provided in respect of proposed improvements to flood defences or natural river channels should be considered as general information for the area in which your property/site is located. It is not specific to individual properties or sites.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Changes to these terms and conditions</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Please check these terms and conditions regularly. We can update them at any time without notice.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
