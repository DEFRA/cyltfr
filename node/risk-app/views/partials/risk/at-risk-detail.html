        {{#if riverAndSeaRiskIsHigh}}
          High risk means that each year this area has a chance of flooding of greater than 3.3% (1 in 30).
        {{else if riverAndSeaRiskIsMedium}}
          Medium risk means that each year this area has a chance of flooding of between 1% (1 in 100) and 3.3% (1 in 30).
        {{else if riverAndSeaRiskIsLow}}
          Low risk means that each year this area has a chance of flooding of between 0.1% (1 in 1000) and 1% (1 in 100).
        {{else if riverAndSeaRiskIsVeryLow}}
          Very low risk means that each year this area has a chance of flooding of less than 0.1% (1 in 1000).
        {{/if}}
        This takes into account the effect of any flood defences in the area.
        These defences reduce, but do not completely stop the chance of flooding as they can be overtopped, or fail.

        <p>
          While there is a risk in this area, flooding from reservoirs is extremely unlikely. There has been no loss of life in the UK from reservoir flooding since 1925.
        </p>
        <p>
          An area is considered at risk if peoples' lives could be threatened by an uncontrolled release of water from a reservoir.
