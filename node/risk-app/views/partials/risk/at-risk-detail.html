          This takes into account the effect of any flood defences in the area.
          These defences reduce, but do not completely stop the chance of flooding as they can be overtopped, or fail.

          Flooding from surface water is difficult to predict as rainfall location and volume are difficult to forecast. 
          In addition, local features can greatly affect the chance and severity of flooding. 
          Because of this, we report the highest risk within 20m of a specific location, such as an individual property. 
          This means reports for neighbouring properties may show different levels of risk.

            While there is a risk in this area, flooding from reservoirs is extremely unlikely. There has been no loss of life in the UK from reservoir flooding since 1925.

            An area is considered at risk if peoples' lives could be threatened by an uncontrolled release of water from a reservoir.
