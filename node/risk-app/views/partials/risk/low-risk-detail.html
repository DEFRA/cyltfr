<h1 class="heading-large">Flood risk technical information for this area</h1>

<!-- Rivers and the sea -->
<h2 class="heading-medium">The flood risk from rivers or the sea is {{riverAndSeaRisk}}</h2>
<h3 class="heading-small">What this means</h3>
<p>
  High risk means that each year, this area has a chance of flooding of greater than 1 in 99 (1%).
  This takes into account the effect of any flood defences in the area.
  These defences reduce, but do not completely stop the chance of flooding as they can be overtopped, or fail.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">How to use this information</h3>
<p>
  You can use this information to see which areas are more likely to flood first, deepest, or most often.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Planning a development</h3>
<p>
  This information is not suitable for use in land-use planning.
  If you’re planning a development, you must use the Risk of Flooding for Land-Use Planning (Rivers and Sea) for England or Development Advisory Map for Wales.
  This is information based on flooding without defences.

<!-- Surface water -->
<h2 class="heading-medium">The flood risk from surface water is {{surfaceWaterRisk}}</h2>
<h3 class="heading-small">What this means</h3>
<p>
  High risk means that each year, this area has a chance of flooding of greater than 1 in 200 (0.5%).
  Flooding from surface water is difficult to predict as rainfall location and volume are difficult to forecast.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">How to use this information</h3>
<p>
  You can use this information to see the approximate areas that would flood, and which parts would be shallower or deeper.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Who’s responsible for surface water flood risk management in this area?</h3>
<p>
  Surface water is managed in this area by {{surfaceWaterManagement}}
</p>

<!-- Reservoirs -->
<h2 class="heading-medium">The flood risk from reservoirs is {{reservoirRisk}}</h2>
<h3 class="heading-small">What this means</h3>
<p>
  Reservoir flooding is extremely unlikely to happen. There has been no loss of life in the UK from reservoir flooding since 1925.
</p>
<p>
  An area is considered at risk if peoples' lives could be threatened by an uncontrolled release of water from a reservoir.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">How to use this information</h3>
<p>
  You can <a href="/map?easting={{easting}}&northing={{northing}}&address={{address}}">see which areas and which properties would flood</a>,
  as well as how deep and fast the water would be.
