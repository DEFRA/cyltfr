      <h2 class="heading-medium">Flood risk from groundwater</h2>
      <p>In some locations, high groundwater levels can cause flooding and disruption in the local area.</p>
      <h2 class="heading-medium">Flood risk from reservoirs</h2>
      <p>
        If a location is at risk, flooding from reservoirs is extremely unlikely. There has been no loss of life in the UK
        from reservoir flooding since 1925.
      </p>
      <p>
        An area is considered at risk if peoples' lives could be threatened by an uncontrolled release of water from a reservoir.
        You can <a href="{{{mountPath}}}map?map=Reservoirs">see a map of the potential extent of flooding</a> if this happened.
