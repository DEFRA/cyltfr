Run job: FR_EA_99_LOAD_ROFRS_ENGLAND

Please note the script below (the s3 destination of the zipped dump file is different to current, also proxy address needs updating to prod one)

!!This is only for the old EC2 database environment.

Job script:
```
cd /srv/imports
export http_proxy=http://10.209.5.13:3128
export https_proxy=http://10.209.5.13:3128
pwd
s3cmd get s3://ltfri/data-updates/latest/rofrs_england.zip --force
unzip -o rofrs_england.zip
sudo -u postgres -g postgres psql -d ltfridev -c "truncate table u_ltfri.rofrs_england_bv_bng"
sudo -u postgres -g postgres psql -d ltfridev -f rofrs_england.sql

sudo -u postgres -g postgres psql -d ltfridev -c "vacuum analyze u_ltfri.rofrs_england_bv_bng"

rm rofrs_england.zip
rm rofrs_england.sql
```

Please view the job here https://lfw-jenkins.aws-int.defra.cloud/view/LTF_TST/job/LTF_TST_99_UPDATE_ROFRS for how the new environment/RDS database load is performed for ROFRS.

The job should take roughly 30 minutes to complete.

Then the tile cache will need copying from the dev tile bucket to the production tile bucket.

```
aws s3 sync s3://flood-risk-dev//LayerGroupInfoImpl--1a2a398b:1510f867e96:-7fd9/ s3://flood-risk-prod//LayerGroupInfoImpl--1a2a398b:1510f867e96:-7fd9/ --delete
```

The tiles for the new environments can be synced from s3://devltfs3bkt001//LayerGroupInfoImpl--1a2a398b:1510f867e96:-7fd9/

Following the data job and tile cache copy a full code build should be run to update the release version and run the automated tests.

# Important Notes

This release is being performed on the old EC2 databases for the release, but the data update and cache copy will also need to be completed for the new production environments, to ensure that when we release the RDS work on the 10th of January we don't have any out of date data or tile cache.
