# Webops intructions

(On old LTFRI environment)

As a reminder, i don't think old ltfri is blue/green so you'll need to take db01 off ELB and load data to it, then switch db01 to the ELB and take off db02.  Run the tile cache copy.  and perform the data load on the offline db02, as follows:

Build job: FR_EA_99_LOAD_RESERVOIRS to load the reservoir data, should take roughly 30 min

Copy job FR_TEST_99_SYNC_CACHE to FR_EA_99_SYNC_CACHE or appropriate name.

Then update the variables in the new job
- http_proxy
- https_proxy
- S3_DESTINATION (appropriate production bucket name to where tile cache is being synced)

Then build the job selecting the following layers:
- DOFRS (Reservoirs)
- DOFR (Reservoirs depth)
- SOFR (Reservoirs speed)

Once the data jobs have been completed perform a full code build and forward test result to flood digital team.

After completing the data job on the old environment this will also need to be performed on the new environments too. New cache copy job is named: LTF_TST_99_COPY_CACHE
